            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
            host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
            programmatic control over them.

            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
            such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
            supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
            (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
            events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
            example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>

            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
            Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about
                JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
            resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
            syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
            JavaScript.

            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
            on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
            object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
            special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
            methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
            implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");</code>
            <ul>
                <li>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
            to certain rules.

            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
            digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
            characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
            as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
            With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            <ul>
                <li>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any
            other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable,
            because it is available only within that function.

            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is
            local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5,
            because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
            is an if statement.</p>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
            <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined</code>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set
            and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying
            the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
            variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as
            for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric,
            or underscore characters.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <ul>
                <li>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
                initialized to a value.</li>
            </ul>
